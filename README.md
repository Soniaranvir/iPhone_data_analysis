# iPhone Data Analysis Project

## üìñ Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of iPhone product data aimed at exploring pricing trends, customer ratings, and other key metrics. It provides insights into the range of iPhones available on Flipkart, including their specifications, ratings, and discounts, enabling a better understanding of consumer behavior and product positioning.

The dataset contains various attributes such as product names, URLs, brand, sale price, MRP, discount percentages, star ratings, RAM, and the number of reviews and ratings. Using Python and its data analysis libraries, we conducted a series of explorations and drew meaningful insights from the data.

## üéØ Objectives
Understand Product Pricing: Identify the price range of iPhones, including the highest and lowest-priced models.
Discover Customer Preferences: Analyze ratings and reviews to understand customer satisfaction.
Explore Discount Trends: Study the discounts applied to different iPhone models.
Gain Insights for Decision-Making: Provide actionable insights for customers and businesses, such as identifying models under a specific price point or with high ratings.
